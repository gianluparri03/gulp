# Gianluca's U? Library Project

GULP is a (really simple) website that can keep track of the books you own and
(maybe) you've read.

Actually, this is a proof of concept, written in Python. Maybe one day, when
it'll be finished, I'll rewrite it (perhaps in another language).

If you want you can contribute by submitting a pull request.

More documentation is coming soon, I promise.
